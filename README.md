A basic calculator running in the command-line. Mainly made this to remember how python works. Currently only the MacOS version is compiled for universal with PyInstaller (Both intel and apple). Updates periodically when I'm interested in working on it. 

## Latest Release Notes

- Added history
- Added square root
- Improved error handling
- Improved stability
- Compiled the source code (for Mac)

## Installation

#### Mac
- Download and extract the ZIP
- Open terminal and run the shell command
- That's it! Whenever you enter `PyCalculator` in the Terminal, it will automatically launch the program! 

#### Windows
 - Install Python 3
 - Download the file
 - Open terminal and navigate into the folder you downloaded in
 - Type the following
    `Python3 Calculator-Windows.py`

Future updates are planned but not guaranteed. Releases and further documentation can be found on the right, and source code is found above.
